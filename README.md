### Operators

The language supports basic arithmetic operators:

- `+` Addition
- `-` Subtraction
- `*` Multiplication
- `/` Division
- `=` Assignment
- `<` Less than
- `<=` Less or Equal than
- `>` Greater than
- `>=` Greater or Equal than
- `==` Equal
- `!=` Different
- `&&` Logical AND
- `||` Logical OR
- `+=` Addition Assignment
- `-=` Subtraction Assignment
- `*=` Multiplication Assignment
- `/=` Division Assignment
- `!`  Logical Negation

## Code Example

```plaintext
create X = "Y is equal to "

create Y = 10

write (X Y)
// Y is equal to 10


// if statement
bet (Y < 15)
{
    yap ("Y is indeed less then 15 ")
    // yap is the same as write
}
betagain(Y > 15)
{
    write ("Y is indeed more then 15 ")
}
badcall
{
    yap (Y)
}

// for loop
stroke (create I = 0; I <= Y; I++)
{
    write (Y)
    write (I)
}
```

## Important Notice
This project is intended for educational purposes only. It is a demonstration of my comprehension with how Compilers and Programming Languages work.
