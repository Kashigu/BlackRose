| L              | false         | ✅           |

### Supports

It supports these type of variables like:
- String
- Number
- Float
- Null
- Array ( with mix types ( [1, "text", W] ) )


### Operators

The language supports basic arithmetic operators:

- `+` Addition
- `-` Subtraction
- `*` Multiplication
- `/` Division
- `=` Assignment
- `<` Less than
- `<=` Less or Equal than
- `>` Greater than
- `>=` Greater or Equal than
- `==` Equal
- `!=` Different
- `&&` Logical AND
- `||` Logical OR
- `+=` Addition Assignment
- `-=` Subtraction Assignment
- `*=` Multiplication Assignment
- `/=` Division Assignment
- `!`  Logical Negation

## Code Example

```plaintext
create X = "Y is equal to "

create Y = 10

write (X Y)
// Y is equal to 10


// if statement
bet (Y < 15)
{
    yap ("Y is indeed less then 15 ")
    // yap is the same as write
}
betagain(Y > 15)
{
    write ("Y is indeed more then 15 ")
}
badcall
{
    yap (Y)
}

// for loop
stroke (create I = 0; I <= Y; I++)
{
    write (Y)
    write (I)
}
```

## How to Install
- Clone the repository 
- Make sure you have ts-node installed globally on your system or else it will never work if you don't have it run:
- `npm install -g ts-node`
- Inside of the folder run: `npm install` and `npm link`

- If you receive a message about ExecutionPolicy go to your Windows Powershell in Administrator mode and write this command:
- `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
- If answered write Y 

- If you desire to go back just run:
- `Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Scope CurrentUser`
- If answered write Y 

### How to Use

After the installation process just run on your console
`blackrose "path of the folder" filename.blk`

## 🤝 Contributing

BlackRose is an educational project to help me and others learn about how compilers and programming languages work.

If you're curious about compilers, interpreters, or just want to explore building a language, feel free to explore the code.

Contributions are welcome — whether it's:
- Reporting bugs 🐞
- Suggesting syntax improvements 💡
- Improving documentation 📚
- Creating examples 🧪

To get started, fork the repo and open a pull request or issue. I’ll be happy to review it!

You can also reach out via the issue tracker if you want to discuss ideas.

## Important Notice
This project is intended for educational purposes only. It is a demonstration of my comprehension with how Compilers and Programming Languages work.
It is not intended for production use, but you're welcome to explore, learn from, or even contribute to the project.
